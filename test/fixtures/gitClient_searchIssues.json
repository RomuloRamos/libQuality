We will need to access the cache itself through the dispatcher because the Client and Server implementations will be different. So let's just put it on the dispatcher instead.\r\n* I'm adding `readCache()` to the dispatcher. It throws on the client because we don't know how it should work yet. On the server, it is created per request. Currently it's created automatically and you can't pass your own. Maybe we'll add that later.\r\n* I'm changing `react-fetch` to use `readCache()` internally. This means that it throws on the Client until we implement it there. I had to rewrite a test since it needs the dispatcher. It's more like an E2E test now. Seems better anyway.\r\n* Finally, this lets me add a `react-fetch` call in the fixture. It only works for the Server Components. I had to disable the `delete require.cache` hack because it doesn't work in ESM mode and breaks our CJS/ESM shared state (the dispatcher).\r\n\r\nPotential next steps would be:\r\n\r\n- Add refetching of the Flight payload to the fixture. (Doesn't require a client cache.)\r\n- Implement a client version of the cache. Likely needs some API to shadow the initial one.\r\n- Constrain the cache API so you can't mess with other source's data.",

                "body": "This is another attempt at solving the memory leak issues mentioned in #17581 and #20088.\r\n\r\nThis PR is similar to #18690 except that it also clears the cached props from the unmounted DOM nodes.\r\n\r\nUnlike #18814, this PR clears the cached fibers and props from *all* unmounted DOM nodes, not just the ones with refs. This is necessary because of #17581: if the browser leaks input nodes, then all of their sibling and parent nodes (up until the node that was detached from the rest of the document) are still accessible from the leaked input node. If any of those nodes still has a reference to a fiber or props, those will leak as well.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it *may* be feasible to treat input nodes like the special snowflakes that they are and explicitly detach them from the rest of the detached nodes so that only the input nodes may actually be retained by the browsers. However, this may also concern other nodes like textareas or select boxes and maybe even contenteditable nodes. So just removing the references to the fibers and props from all unmounted nodes seems a lot simpler to me.\r\n\r\nNeither #18690 nor #18814 solved the memory leaks for my app, which regularly uses multiple gigabytes of RAM and sometimes even crashes Chrome because it can't allocate more memory. The changes in this PR seemingly brought the memory usage back to more appropriate levels (megabytes instead of gigabytes), though I haven't pushed them to production yet. Also, clearing the fiber and props cache helped me to resolve an unrelated memory leak in my app because it was *much* easier to see which DOM nodes still had references to my components without having to comb through every possible branch of the fiber tree.\r\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9.

This is just a change to the readme in a few spots where I thought the grammar or wording could be improved so no tests for this commit. The first change I made was to change \"you're using\" to \"you're planning to use\" because I thought this future tense fit better in the context of showing users how to get started with React. If they're just getting started, they're probably planning to use it and not already using it. The second change I made was from \"This is a great place to get started.\" to \"This is a great place to start when looking to contribute to React for the first time.\" I just thought the first one cut off abruptly so I added a bit more depth and wanted to mention \"React\" again at the end of the readme because I thought it sounded nice. \r\nIf anyone's willing, I'm pretty new to contributing to opensource and doing actual outside of classroom code(I'm a sophomore in college), can someone explain tests to me? Before I typed this commit up there was autofilled text that mentioned things like \"yarn\" and how we should include our own tests, what is that exactly? Thank you!",

Either include it or remove the dependency array.\r\nconst allIds = useMemo(() => Object.keys(byId), undefined)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is clearly noticeable together with TypeScript as it does not allow omitting the second `deps` parameter, with the following typings:\r\n```typescript\r\n// allow undefined, but don't make it optional as that is very likely a mistake\r\nfunction useMemo<T>(factory: () => T, deps: DependencyList | undefined): T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote here that `deps` must be either a `DependencyList` or `undefined`.

Install `\"eslint-plugin-react-hooks\": \"^4.1.0\"` and extend it with `'plugin:react-hooks/recommended'`\r\n2. Write a hook that required a dependency list, input `undefined`.\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nGives false positive when given `undefined` for `deps`.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nShould allow `deps` to be set to undefined.",

So I would be very thankful for better suggestion or clarifying how to handle this issues:\r\n\r\nIt looks that it confuses also a lot of developers and it is quite difficult to write work-arounds for the most common use-cases:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920\r\n\r\nHere I provide few examples that really are not easy to be set-up with this rule:\r\n\r\n**Example 1**: Initialization of app - or check cookies/localstorage once the application loads, and set them in the context:\r\n\r\n    import React, { useState, createContext, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n    import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';\r\n    import CookieHandler from '../helpers/CookieHandler';\r\n    import Loading from '../components/common/Loading';\r\n    \r\n    const defaultValues = {\r\n      authorization: {\r\n        loggedIn: false,\r\n        isAdmin: false,\r\n      },\r\n      dispatchAuthorization: () => {},\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    const LoginContext = createContext(defaultValues);\r\n    \r\n    const reducer = (state, authorization = { loggedIn: false, isAdmin: false }) => {\r\n      const { loggedIn, isAdmin } = authorization;\r\n      return { loggedIn: !!loggedIn, isAdmin: !!isAdmin };\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    const LoginContextProvider = ({ children }) => {\r\n      const [authorization, dispatchAuthorization] = React.useReducer(reducer, defaultValues.authorization);\r\n      const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);\r\n      const { i18n } = useTranslation();\r\n    \r\n      const setLoginData = (token, isAdmin) => {\r\n        if (token) {\r\n          dispatchAuthorization({\r\n            loggedIn: true,\r\n            isAdmin: isAdmin,\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n        setMounted(true);\r\n      };\r\n    \r\n      const setLanguage = (language) => {\r\n        i18n.changeLanguage(language);\r\n        CookieHandler.setLanguage(language);\r\n      };\r\n    \r\n      const loginUser = data => {\r\n        CookieHandler.setToken(data.token);\r\n        CookieHandler.setAdmin(data.isAdmin);\r\n        setLoginData(data.token, data.isAdmin);\r\n      };\r\n    \r\n      const removeLoginData = () => {\r\n        CookieHandler.logout();\r\n        dispatchAuthorization({\r\n          loggedIn: false,\r\n          isAdmin: false,\r\n        });\r\n      };\r\n    \r\n      useEffect(() => {\r\n        const token = CookieHandler.getToken();\r\n        const isAdmin = CookieHandler.getAdmin();\r\n        const language = CookieHandler.getLanguage();\r\n    \r\n        if (token) {\r\n          setLoginData(token, isAdmin);\r\n        } else if (authorization.loggedIn || authorization.isAdmin) removeLoginData();\r\n    \r\n        if (language) setLanguage(language);\r\n        setMounted(true);\r\n        // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n      }, []);\r\n    \r\n      if (!mounted) return <Loading />;\r\n    \r\n      return (\r\n        <LoginContext.Provider\r\n          value={{\r\n            authorization,\r\n            dispatchAuthorization,\r\n            setLoginData,\r\n            loginUser,\r\n            setLanguage,\r\n            logoutUser: removeLoginData,\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          {children}\r\n        </LoginContext.Provider>\r\n      );\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    const LoginContextConsumer = LoginContext.Consumer;\r\n    \r\n    export { LoginContext, LoginContextProvider, LoginContextConsumer };\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I want that the `useEffect` is called really **once** the application is loaded, and never again. But according to eslint I should add the authorization variable in the dept array, but that is something I really don't want to do. Because each time there is a change in the authorization, the whole INIT-Prozess will start over and over again. I think an init-functionality that fires once the component/or application starts is quite needed, without thinking of changing in variables later?\r\n\r\n**Example 2:** Use of functions that are comming from hooks. An example with **react-i18next**:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    const MyComponent = ({ someId }) => {\r\n     const { t } = useTranslation();\r\n     const [data, setData] = useState(null);\r\n      useEffect(() => {\r\n        const someAsyncFetch = async () => {\r\n      try {\r\n        const data = await asyncFetchData({\r\n          someId,\r\n        });\r\n        setData(data);\r\n        toastr.success(t('your.data.was.fetched.successfully'));\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        console.log(e);\r\n        toastr.error(t('your.data.can.not.be.fetched'));\r\n      }\r\n     };\r\n        someAsyncFetch();\r\n      }, [someId]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this example, I want to get all the data when my component gets rendered, or when the someId is changed. When data is loaded or error comes - I fire toastr message with the translation function **t** that I get in a hook. But I don't want to get new data each time the user switch his language. But eslint want me to put t in the deps array, which causes to re-render component and load new data each time the user switch the language. And moreover, we should expect that more and more such hook-functions will come in future, which we eventually may want to use in the useEffects.\r\n\r\n**Example 3:** One variable is depending on other variables\r\n\r\n      useEffect(() => {\r\n        if (error === null) {\r\n          const data = doSomethingWithMyValue(value1);\r\n          setMyData(data);\r\n        } else {\r\n          showSomeErrorText(); //or do nothing\r\n        }\r\n      }, [value1]);\r\n\r\nIf I want that only when value1 changes, the function doSomethingWithMyValue will be fired, but not when error changes. When we put error inside the `useEffects` deps array then the whole logic is broken, because useEffect will be fired each time error changes. And this is something I don't want. \r\n\r\nI tried also to make some kind of workaround with a mounted variable, and `useCallback`, but it looks for me that `useEffect` fires unnecessary many times, and somehow the whole thing is slower.\r\n\r\nSo is there somewhere a logic-catch or we really need to use all this memo and `useCallbacks` etc. to prevent some serious issue?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback!",

In order to do so, I needed to make the types `Lane`, `Lanes`, `LaneMap`, and `LanePriority` into non-opaque types, which may go against their intent. Open to suggestions if there's a cleaner way to remove the cycle between `ReactFiberLane` and `ReactInternalTypes` that preserves the opaque tag.\r\n\r\n### Cycle detection\r\n\r\nI used a tool called [`madge`](https://github.com/pahen/madge) to detect cyclical imports. This change brings the number of cycles in the `packages/react-reconciler` package down from 50 to 48.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the following cycles:\r\n```\r\n1) ReactFiberLane.js > ReactInternalTypes.js\r\n2) ReactFiberLane.js > SchedulerWithReactIntegration.new.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nSince this change only affects the location of a type and constant definitions, there shouldn't be any need to add or change tests.\r\n",

[]; // The 'arr' logical expression could make the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 54) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the initialization of 'arr' in its own useMemo() Hook.\r\n```\r\nReference: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19590",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nFixes #20204.\r\n\r\nDependency array parsing crashes when it encounters optional-chained function calls, e.g. `props?.attribute.method()`.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {}, [someObject?.optionalField.method()]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- `React Hook useEffect has a complex expression in the dependency array. Extract it to a separate variable so it can be statically checked.`\r\n\r\nActual: \r\n- `Cannot read property 'type' of undefined`\r\n- No lint errors are displayed due to linter crash\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\nUnit tests:\r\n- Added missing test for checking function call as dependency: `[props.method()]`\r\n- Added test validating fix. Contains optional-chained function call: `[props?.attribute.method()]`\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Linted [164 repositories](https://github.com/AriPerkkio/eslint-remote-tester/blob/master/eslint-remote-tester.react.config.js#L2-L168) before and after the fix. The only change was that the previously crashing file was no more crashing. Every other lint warning was as before. ",

Create `index.mjs` with the following content:\r\n   ```js\r\n   import * as jsx from 'react/jsx-runtime';\r\n   console.log(jsx);\r\n   ```\r\n4. Run `node index.mjs`\r\n5. Run `npx webpack-cli path/to/index.mjs`\r\n   - I had to use an absolute path on my machine or webpack-cli wouldn't find `index.mjs`, don't know why.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nAfter discussion with @gaearon , and iterating in PRs #19997 and #19971 , this should balance all the feedback and constraints.\r\n\r\nAt its core, this approach removes the type definitions from the ReactCurrent* and makes the polymorphism late-binding via (future) type checks at runtime (presumably in __DEV__ mode). This eliminates the root of most of the type import cycle.\r\n\r\nThe other type import cycle was LazyComponent, which I moved to be alongside the other component type definitions. Looking at the resulting changes in import statements, this looks like is coheres better and follows the convention of storing those component typedefs in that file.\r\n\r\nI did not remove the cyclical dependency workarounds in the jest and rollup scripts, to keep this PR small.\r\n\r\nThanks again for taking the time to review and discuss.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nI ran `yarn test`, `yarn flow dom|dom-relay|test|fabric`, and `yarn lint`.\r\n",

I'd like to be able to add additional custom hooks to that \"safe list\". I understand this is potentially very dangerous, but we have a handful of hooks that simply wrap `useRef` with some logic. The returned result is essentially just a `useRef` result, so it's perfectly safe to ignore as a dependency.\r\n\r\nI'm imagining something like this in the eslint config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"rules\": {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": [\"warn\", {\r\n      \"safeHooks\": \"(useRefWrapper|useOtherRefWrapper)\"\r\n    }]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `useRefWrapper` might look like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst useRefWrapper = () => {\r\n  const ref = useRef();\r\n  if (ref.current) {\r\n    console.log('hi!');\r\n  }\r\n  return ref;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like a reasonable option, assuming the documentation has a clear caveat mentioning the dangers? If so, I'm happy to work on implementation.",

Lint file with contents below\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// useCustomHook.js\r\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport function useCustomHook(someObject) {\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    }, [\r\n      someObject?.optionalField.method(),\r\n    ]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// .eslint.rc\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    root: true,\r\n    env: {\r\n        es6: true,\r\n    },\r\n    parserOptions: {\r\n        ecmaVersion: 2020,\r\n        sourceType: 'module',\r\n        ecmaFeatures: {\r\n            jsx: true,\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    settings: {\r\n        react: {\r\n            version: 'detect',\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    plugins: ['react-hooks'],\r\n    extends: [\r\n        'plugin:react-hooks/recommended',\r\n    ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nESlint reports error: `Cannot read property 'type' of undefined Occurred while linting <file>`.\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/13a62feab8c39bc0292eb36d636af0bb4f3a78df/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/ExhaustiveDeps.js#L1624-L1625\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nESlint rule should not crash. According to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/18819#issuecomment-655151489 optional chaining should be supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was testing [an ESLint testing tool](https://github.com/AriPerkkio/eslint-remote-tester) I've been creating and ran into this issue. I can work on a fix for this later if needed. \r\n\r\nHere's the results and log.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Error result</summary>\r\n\r\n  ## Rule: unable-to-parse-rule-id\r\n- Message: `Cannot

Source maps will help you see the real function names and explore them. (The points below apply for source maps as well.)\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to profile React's performance — none of them provide a low-level view of what's happening. I believe the best way to profile React is using Chrome's Performance tab using a non-minified production build. Here's why:\r\n- **Familiar.** People use the Performance tab for every other performance profiling so they are familiar with how to use it.\r\n- **Powerful.** The Performance tab is extremely powerful. Years of engineering have been put into developing it.\r\n- **Better understanding.** When using the React DevTools profiler I have a common problem – I see a component being rendered slowly but I don't know what is causing it. In order to understand I need a more low-level view. Here are some questions that can be answered only with the Chrome Performance tab:\r\n    - What's the balance between the app's code and React execution times? Should I implement some frequently updated components using custom non-React implementation?\r\n    - What time is spend on setting attribute values, setting `innerHTML` and adding and removing listeners?\r\n    - What time is spent on disposing effects? Is there a specific dispose function that is taking more than usual?\r\n    - What time is spent on mounting effects? Is there a specific effect mount that is taking more than usual?\r\n\r\n## Disadvantages\r\n\r\nAs with every solution, there are some drawbacks to using this approach:\r\n- **Documentation needed.** In order to make sense of what's happening you will need some knowledge of the core functions in React. A little guide with the names of the functions for mount/unmount, effects, and DOM manipulations will be useful. This of course can be done by the community(you are already linking to some community posts in React's documentation).\r\n- **Requires more skill.** This isn't for everybody. It's aimed at more experienced developers. This type of profiling is a lot more overwhelming than the current approach.\r\n- **May not fit your principles.** Maybe it's not part of your principles to introduce and promote such a complicated solution. Maybe you are more interested in searching for a more elegant and minimal solution.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nSince ReactFiberSuspenseContext is mostly just using ReactFiberStack, I added tests to that part too as part of these changes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change.

Start profiling the app (using `Profiler` tab of React Developer Tools).\r\n2. Click on a cell.\r\n3. Stop profiling the app and check re-rendered components.\r\n4. Wrap `Wrapper` component in `forwardRef` (see the code in the repo below) and repeat steps 1-3.\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/usage-of-reacforwardref-in-reactmemo-81cuh?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nWithout `forwardRef`: according to the profiling report, all the cells re-render.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772842-c4a42e00-1b5b-11eb-9b49-8d2bd6f122aa.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772848-d4bc0d80-1b5b-11eb-8f41-9378bc7418ba.png)\r\n\r\nWith `forwardRef`: according to the profiling report, only the changed cell re-renders.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772866-fcab7100-1b5b-11eb-9de9-c4aa34b48299.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772876-07fe9c80-1b5c-11eb-8038-aa9a0ffce473.png)\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThere should be no difference in the reports. I added some `console.log`-s and they demonstrate that adding `forwardRef` doesn't improve performance/reduce re-renders, which seems correct.\r\n\r\nCC @kentcdodds",

In the case of the chrome extension this is fine because the node is never unmounted, but in use cases with `react-devtools-inline` (eg: codesandbox), where you are only given one <DevTools/> instance this causes the bridge to be closed, and never recreated if for whatever reason <DevTools/> is unmounted (which happens when switching tabs).\r\n\r\nI am willing to submit a PR, but wanted to discuss the fix before making it - the fix I see is adding a flag to <DevTools/> to not close the bridge on unmount, and making it an opt-in flag users of <DevTools/> (recommended in the case of react-devtools-inline). Adding an ability to manually access the bridge would then let the developer manually control the lifecycle - but I'm unsure the risk/issue of keeping a dangling bridge open, so I don't see this as strictly necessary.\r\n\r\nReact version: N/A\r\nReact-devtools-inline: 4.9.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  Create a code-sandbox React environment\r\n2. Open React DevTools tab\r\n3. Switch to Problems tab (or any other tab)\r\n4. Switch back to React DevTools tab\r\n5. Bridge has been closed, `index.js:55 Cannot send message \"highlightNativeElement\" through a Bridge that has been shutdown.` is printed in console. New react nodes can not be inspected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example: N/A\r\nCode example isn't relevant, any CodeSandbox will reproduce this. (even with no additional code)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nInspecting elements that haven't previously been inspected will fail because bridge communication fails if the <DevTools/> ever unmounts and remounts\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe bridge doesn't close even on unmount when using `react-devtools-inline`, or an option is available when mounting <DevTools/> to not automatically close the bridge.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: experimental\r\n\r\nI found this bug while trying out `useOpaqueIdentifier` on a component that uses `aria-activedescendant`. It works great on a CRA app, but it breaks on server rendered apps.\r\n\r\nThe way it's implemented is that each item registers its id into a state up in the tree so the container element can get the active id and render it on the `aria-activedescendant` prop.\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple server rendered app (for example, using Next.js).\r\n2. Create a component that uses `React.unstable_useOpaqueIdentifier` and passes the generated object to a component up in the tree through callbacks.\r\n3. Try to render the generated ID to a prop in the ancestor component. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-useopaqueidentifier-aria-activedescendant-bug-geutb?file=/pages/index.js:0-412\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nIt throws an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Runtime Error\r\nError: The object passed back from useOpaqueIdentifier is meant to be passed through to attributes only.

Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nThe command fails silently and nothing happens.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nReact DevTools should start and connect to app.\r\n\r\nI am not sure this is the right place to post this, but since I know how to fix this issue and I think other people might face it, I'm opening this thread to also post the solution.\r\n\r\nI run into this issue on Linux (debian bullseye with kernel 5.7.0). The main problem is connected to Electron (afaik since version 5) not being able to launch without binary being owned by root and chmod 4755. The issue is with the new sandbox and the priviledges it requires to launch. \r\n\r\nThere is also another workaround I found some months ago on the dedicated thread from Electron's GH (since this is a common issue for Linux users of all Electron applications) that works for every packaged Electron app and binary.\r\nInstead of modifying the electron binary permissions, you can instead tweak an option of your running kernel by doing: \r\n```\r\nsudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThen your Electron apps will launch, and thus so will React DevTools.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this if it isn't relevant here (since not really an issue with devtools itself, rather with Electron x Debian), but I haven't found anything regarding this matter and I think someone might encounter this issue in the future (hoping I'm not totaly mistaken about this to begin with :smile:)",

I know recommended approach is to use refs, but why have redundant work with sync ref and state. If it is safe to access current state due function updater for setState so you can omit unnecessary state deps for callback, why it might be not safe to get current state in async handler?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nYou have “follow” user button. When you click it update local state optimistically and make server request. While server request pending you might click again and change local state, but prevent making new requests. When request is resolved you need to compare latest local state and expected server state and repeat request if they aren’t equal.\r\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

                "body": "Currently `react` and `react-is` are built using a `shared/` package. That means that `react-is` (just like `react-dom`) has to have the same version number as `react` to avoid potential issues due to different code from `shared/`.\r\n\r\nHowever, right now a lot of [libraries are wrongly declaring `react-is` as a direct dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/react-is)<sup>1</sup> while declaring  `react` as a peer. Technically correct would be declaring `react-is` as a peer as well leading to more burden for app developers. This is slightly different to having `react` as a peer dependency because every app developer also needs `react` as a dependency. The same doesn't always hold true for `react-is`.\r\n\r\nSince `react-is` has no dependencies it would be more ergonomically for libraries if `react-is` would be available from `react/is` since they already have `react` as a peer dependency. There are two possibilities for this:\r\n1. Move `react-is` to `react/is`\r\n1. Make `react-is` a dependency of `react` and re-export it from `react/is`\r\n\r\nI guess marking `react-is` as a peer would be the approach that would be more consistent. It's really just annoying for libraries but if that's what you would recommend then I'm fine with it as well.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this is really just a technicality right now i.e. I haven't seen any actual issues. I just stumbled over it while working on React 17 compat. So far it looks like we're in a position to declare 16.8 and 17 as the range for react in our `peerDependencies` which leaves us with a slightly awkward `\"react-is\": \"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0\"` in the `dependencies` (I might be trying too hard to avoid additional peer deps).\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Popular examples include `prop-types`, `react-redux`, `react-router`, `@material-ui/core`,  `next`\r\n",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: ^16.13.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Mount an input component\r\n2. Type anything\r\n3. Unmount input component\r\n\r\nSmall code sample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst InputWrapper = () => {\r\n  const Siblings = React.useMemo(() => new Array(1000).fill(1).map((_,i) => <div key={i}/>), []);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input />\r\n      {Siblings}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport const Demo = () => {\r\n  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const handleShow = React.useCallback(() => {\r\n    setShow((prev) => !prev);\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const closeRef = React.useRef<number>(0);\r\n  \r\n  const handleShowMany = React.useCallback(() => {\r\n    closeRef.current = 0;\r\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\r\n      setShow(prev => !prev);\r\n      if (closeRef.current++ > 10000) {\r\n        clearInterval(id);\r\n      }\r\n    }, 1);\r\n  }, [setShow])\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button onClick={handleShow}>{show ? \"hide\" : \"show\"}</button>\r\n      <button onClick={handleShowMany}>{closeRef.current}</button>\r\n      {show && <InputWrapper />}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nCurrently when mounting the input controller for the first time, a small increase in fiber nodes occurs, and after typing in the input box, seemingly the entire React fiber tree is leaked. When mounting/unmounting the input again, there is no clean up (even after thousands of iterations).\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe fiber nodes to be cleaned up after unmounting the input element.\r\n\r\nComparison memory+fiber nodes on Chrome 69 vs Chrome 86:\r\n\r\n**Chrome 69**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064044-3e368d80-1558-11eb-8676-3ee913542cc5.png)\r\n\r\n**Chrome 86**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064051-4db5d680-1558-11eb-834b-04a26f4c507a.png)\r\n\r\n**Note the 600kb increase in memory per scenario in Chrome 86, vs the <100KB in Chrome 69, as well as the difference in Fiber nodes**\r\n\r\n**The final number of fiber nodes in the Chome 69 snapshot is the same as the initial count of fiber nodes in Chrome 86 after mounting the input element for the first time:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064148-ca48b500-1558-11eb-9b41-ca397b1156a7.png)\r\n",

                "body": "This is a weird one. Basically, if you add an event listener to the document in an effect that was triggered by an event. e.g. `click` toggles some state, which triggers an effect, which adds a `click` handler to the document. In the normal case the new event handler will \"miss\" the triggering event, e.g. the added click handler won't respond to the click event that triggered it being added (omg). \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, if you render a portal first, the timing changes slightly and the added event handler will see the current event.\r\n\r\nReact version: 17\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-cyt0f?file=/index.js\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"show Message\" button to see a message toggle in and out\r\n2. Click the \"Render Portal\" button (see a portal rendered into the body)\r\n3. Click the \"show Message\" button again and notice nothing happens\r\n\r\nThe reason for the final behavior is the click event both opens and closes the message, (calls set state twice)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-cyt0f?file=/index.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThat they be consistent",

                "body": "Today, `useLayoutEffect` can be used for synchronous read/writes across the DOM.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n  // Write\r\n  ref.current.style.transform = \"\"\r\n\r\n  // Read\r\n  const box = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a single instance of a single component, this works well. But if this code is repeated or reused anywhere in the tree, we trigger  [layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing). The severity of the layout thrashing scales linearly with the number of hooks/components featuring either this code or code like it.\r\n\r\nHooks and components are designed to be composable, yet it's this trivial to write one that isn't. \r\n\r\nInstead, what I'd like is a batched version of `useLayoutEffect` that provides `read` and `write` callbacks. These schedule callbacks that will be called:\r\n\r\n1. Synchronously before paint\r\n2. In \"parallel\" in reads/writes/reads etc\r\n3. After all child components in the tree have run `useLayoutEffect` - including those entering the tree (currently these don't mount until after other `useLayoutEffect`s have been called)\r\n\r\nIt could look like this, though I'm more interested in the above specs than actual API:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseBatchedLayoutEffect((read, write) => {\r\n  write(() =>  {\r\n    ref.current.style.transform = \"\"\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  read(() => {\r\n    const box = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, adhering the 3 specifications above, these callbacks are executed in order, so all `read`s from across the tree, then all `write`s, then all `read`s etc. There is no upper limit for the number of permitted ping-ponged reads/writes IMO as the amount of layout thrashing you could possibly suffer will never be worse than the single hungriest hook. In my experience I've never needed more than a read/write/read/write.\r\n\r\n## Measurement accuracy\r\n\r\nIn the given example, we're measuring a component after first resetting its `transform` because we want to snapshot its actual bounding box without any transforms applied. But if this component is [nested in itself](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-varahamihira-2qiyw?file=/src/App.js), so both a parent and child are performing the same type of animation, we want to unset all the transforms before measuring any of the elements, otherwise the resulting measurements will be incorrect.\r\n\r\n## What about `requestAnimationFrame`?\r\n\r\nTheoretically it could be possible to implement this ourselves in userland by creating a batcher that executes on the next available frame. Sadly this isn't possible in practise. For whatever browser-internal reason it is necessary to run these reads and writes synchronously to prevent flashes of incorrectly-styled components.\r\n\r\nIf you play with this very simple layout animation implementation by clicking on the red box you'll see it suffers no flashes:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/broken-star-cycfz?file=/src/App.js:528-537\r\n\r\nBut if you uncomment the wrapping `requestAnimationFrame` within the `useLayoutEffect` you'll see it does randomly flash with the undesired styles.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

The user could very well have a custom module that aliases the react module (`export * from 'react'`) and then exposes other custom hooks along with it. I could definitely be missing some nuance here, so please let me know if the test case is actually valid and I'll try to address it in a follow up.",

                "body": "I've been asked about the safety of a certain pattern and I'd like to clarify this with you (the React team). \r\n\r\nIn my opinion - the actual SSRed output and the hydrating tree **do not have to match**. This is, of course, a weird space of things and one should understand how things work together to even think about it, but there is no technical aspect forbidding this now. Question is - is it safe to assume that such a \"use case\" will stay supported in the future. I believe it is because the only thing that is used as an input to the rehydration is the current HTML structure and the React team doesn't intend to ship any extra metadata in the SSRed output about the actual render tree that was used to render it.\r\n\r\nThis can be a little bit of a vague question - so let's take a look at an example. Emotion does 2 things on the server differently than on the client:\r\n1. it does not use `React.forwardRef` (refs are useless on the server, so we don't see a need to grow the render tree rather significantly by using it)\r\n2. we render `<style>` elements \"inline\", together with other elements. This is an example SSRed output:\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"react-root\">\r\n  <style data-emotion-css=\"bjcoli\">\r\n    .css-bjcoli{color:green;}\r\n  </style>\r\n  <div class=\"css-bjcoli\">\r\n    <style data-emotion-css=\"ihiui2\">\r\n      .css-ihiui2{color:hotpink;}\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"css-ihiui2\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"css-ihiui2\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the client we:\r\n- use `React.forwardRef` as it's important to do so\r\n- we **move** `<style>` elements to the `<head>` **before** rehydration can even be called\r\n\r\nThis makes the HTML structure **identical** to what React sees during the first render so there is **no SSR mismatch**, even though initially there kinda is one.\r\n\r\nWe totally understand this is a gray area and trickery - question is: do u plan to make things like this break in the future? I totally would understand the answer being \"we can't guarantee that\", but at the same time it would be great if it would be accompanied by \"probably not, this is _safe_ to do and there are no plans to make this break now\"\r\n\r\ncc @eps1lon ",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nIn trying to align the Roblox Lua version of React (Roact), we came across some circular dependencies between the scheduler, reconciler, and the react packages. Upon deeper inspection, we saw that there are specific workarounds in the rollup scripts and elsewhere to accommodate the circular dependency. After a brief Twitter conversation with @gaearon , we decided to take a crack at untangling them, simplifying the design and eliminating the workarounds from the rollup files. The change looks large, but it is mostly tweaking import paths after moving files. The PR #19971 shows how the untangling can work, end-to-end, passing all tests/flow, and not introducing any new code/design smells.\r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons for the circular dependencies between scheduler, reconciler, and react pacakges, is the responsibilities that are the backing implementation for the ``ReactSharedInternals`` (aka ``__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED``) symbol aren't cohered in a place in the dependency (import) chain that's consistent with the places it currently needs to be imported from. This PR is the first step of taking the bare minimum changes, a very thin slice of the end-to-end transformation is represented in #19971 .\r\n\r\nBased on feedback to #19971 , this PR extracts only the **non-implementation** files (**types**/**stubs**) first, as requested by @gaearon . As such, this PR by itself doesn't break the circular dependencies. If this PR is merged, I'll rebase #19971 and create a new, thin PR that moves the next set of **non-implementation** files (**const**/**stubs** only).\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nOn a MacBook Pro with node 14.12.0, Ran all test, flow, lint, and prettier targets. This included tests with the production and variant environments.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\nReact is not preventing infinite rendering/looping and results in freezing of browser. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is because the dependency array of `useEffect` compares object/array by reference. But, this is a serious issue because \r\n- This is a common trap people might get into because of dynamic nature of Javascript, and people might not know the thing they are passing to dependency array is a primitive value or an array/object.\r\n- React should catch this infinite rendering and throw a helpful error. This error is already thrown by React for some of the cases. But, clearly React does not catch this for all the cases.\r\n- The documentation of  `useEffect` does not have a single reference to this gotcha - guarding against passing object/array to the dependency array, since reference of the object/array is being checked, not a deep comparison value. Some solutions already exist like https://github.com/kentcdodds/use-deep-compare-effect, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54095994/react-useeffect-comparing-objects/63965274#63965274. But, only people who are aware of this behaviour of `useEffect` will reach out to these solutions (or they might manually deep compare with their own custom hook as some people do in the linked stackoverflow link)\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if `useEffect` includes a helpful option like \r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n // myArray, myObject gets new reference on evey render\r\n}, [myArray, myObject], {\r\n   deepCompare: true/false // it would be helpful to have this instead of reaching for custom hooks/npm packages\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact version:\r\n`16.12.x` (any latest version)\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Click the `codesandbox` link - https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-client-uselazyquery-example-forked-kmc1u?file=/src/App.js. \r\n2. Click `Topics` link and then select `Countries` link. \r\n\r\n`Warning`: Please be aware that tab/browser will freeze. It is better to open the console before hand, so that you can see the looping from console logs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\n[CodeSandbox reproduction](https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-client-uselazyquery-example-forked-kmc1u?file=/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior:\r\n- React does not prevent infinite loop/rendering. Browser tab freezes, and the end user has no idea that the tab has freezed. They have to force quit the tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- React should give a helpful warning that an infinite render/loop is going on.\r\n- React should pinpoint the exact issue - the array/object passed to `useEffect` dependency is triggering infinite rendering\r\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nIn trying to align the Roblox Lua version of React (Roact), we came across some circular dependencies. After a brief Twitter conversation with @gaearon , we decided to take a crack at untangling them. The change looks large, but it is mostly tweaking import paths after moving files.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not sure 'shared' is the right place for some of these things, I think that being able to see the shape of things  will make it clearer how these things could have reasonable cohesion, encapsulate detail, and not have any cycles.\r\n\r\nIt felt particularly good to delete some workaround in the rollup/build scripts that were only there to trick tools into not getting stuck on the circular dependencies. I'd like to be able to remove the ReactSharedInternals reference in react/React.js and just export is from react/index.js, but it looks like some of the tooling demands that it stay there. There were other little things I left in place like that, to not unnecessarily disrupt things.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nOn a MacBook Pro with node 14.12.0, there are a few tests that fail after a fresh checkout. I want to see if those come up in CI as well, or if it's something in my environment. Besides that caveat, ran all test, flow, lint, and prettier targets. As you'll see in the commits, a few of the circular dependencies were purely in types and had to be worked out.",
